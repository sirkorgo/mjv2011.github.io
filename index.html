    Hi there! I’m mjv2011, pronounced em jay vee two-zero-one-one, and I make
    content online sometimes. I like art and 3D modeling, some game development,
    I guess! <br /><br />
    I dunno what to write here in all honesty<br />
    Um<br /><br />
    I mostly make content with my friends, actually- it’ll be a rare sight if
    you see me, like, streaming solo or making a video with nobody else in it or
    something. As of writing this, I don’t make videos very often, but I like
    putting a lot of effort into my editing.<br /><br />
    I also like. Don’t have many detailed characters? They’re all little shape
    people that live in a city named Geopolis. I like to think I gave them at
    least okay lore, though! Of course, you’ll have to go to my awesome
    “Characters” page to read their lore, haha. I promise the page is cool!<br /><br />
    Anyways go visit the pages on this website and use the little sidebars on
    the right. Or don’t, I don’t care Lol
